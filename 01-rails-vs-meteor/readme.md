# Rails vs Meteor!

## Who

[Jesse Shawl](https://twitter.com/jshawl) and [Ramsay Lanier](https://twitter.com/verybadhello)

## What

A Basic CRUD app:

- Users can log in / sign up for an account
- Users can log out
- Users can create/read/edit/delete posts
- Users can create/read/edit/delete comments
- Users can only delete their own comments
- The User who created the post can delete any comments on that post
- Deployed to the internet

### Ignoring

- Styles. It's a dev battle!
- Performance. It's a race!
- Good practices in general. Just make it work.
